// Basic structure of c++ programming 
#include<iostream> // use important things in this program from iostream file [header file] (iostream is used to get input and give output)
// Note: we have more header files in cpp 

int main() {     // int means integer (this function will return integer value) and main is the function name ( entry point of the program )
    std::cout<<"Hello world";
    return 0; // (good practice to use otherwise your program will not give any error)
}
